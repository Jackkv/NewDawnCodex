# Skills

Skills are the foundation of character development in New Dawn. This comprehensive guide covers all available skills.

## Overview

In Ultima Online, your character is defined by skills rather than classes. You have **700 total skill points** to distribute across many different skills.

## Skill Categories

Skills are organized into several categories:

- **[Combat Skills](combat.md)** - Weapon proficiencies and fighting
- **[Magic Skills](magic.md)** - Spellcasting and magical abilities
- **[Crafting Skills](crafting.md)** - Creating items and equipment
- **[Miscellaneous Skills](misc.md)** - Utility, social, and other skills

## How Skills Work

### Skill Points

- Each skill ranges from 0.0 to 100.0
- You have 700.0 total points to spend
- Skills gain through use
- Higher skills = harder to improve

### Skill Gain

Skills improve when you:

1. Successfully use the skill
2. Attempt challenging actions
3. Have skill gains unlocked (not capped)

!!! tip "Skill Gain Mechanics"
    - Gains are checked after skill use
    - Higher difficulty = better gain chance
    - Skills near cap gain very slowly
    - Some skills gain passively during combat

### Skill Locks

- **Up Arrow (↑)** - Skill can increase
- **Down Arrow (↓)** - Skill can decrease
